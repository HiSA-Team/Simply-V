# Software for UninaSoC
The sw directory is organized in two major components:
* `host/` - Contains software that runs on the host side, typically x86-based systems. This includes host applications to interface with UninaSoC. Currently, it only applies to HPC configurations, see [host/virtual_uart/README.md](host/virtual_uart/README.md),
* `SoC/`  - Contains software for UninaSoC, see [SoC/README.md](SoC/README.md),
