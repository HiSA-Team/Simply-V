# UninaSoC
RISC-V SoC design for FPGA fast prototyping from University of Naples Federico II.

# Supported boards:
TBD

# TODO:
* Choose simulator
* Choose target board(s)
* Choose a Vivado version (2022.2 for now)
* Design address space -> linker script in sw/linker
* Choose and import xilinx IPs 
    * align with vivado version
    * figure out if to import simulation files
* Choose and import other IPs (e.g. PULP), check license
    * this includes a set of RVM cores
* Build and verify first design
