## XDMA maximum BAR size

> The safe (and adopted) maximum BAR size is 32 MB on the MSI Z590 PLUS (MS-7D11) motherboard, but it strictly depends on the motherboard.

> **WARNING** If you use a greater BAR size your system BIOS could not be able to allocate the required space for the PCIe device, hence it cannot be able to boot properly and the entire system will crash.
